'''
list is a data type that stores elements in a list (array)
ex_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
this list has a length of 5 elements  (integer elements)
indexes range from 0-4
can access elemenets of a list
 ex_list[0]
 will access the 0 index of the list
 
 Looping through lists
 for loops are strong tools to iterate through elements of a list
 
 ex:
 for element in ex_list:
    print(element)

this will output 
1
2
3
4
5

can also iterate through a list using its indexes

for i in range(len(ex_list)):
    print(ex_list[i])

will output the same as above

Properties of a list:
once a list has been created
it can be modified in multiple ways
- elements can be changed
ex:
ex_list[0] = 0
will change element with index 0 to the value of 0

- elements can be added or deleted
exs:
ex_list.append(6)
will add the element 6 to the list in the max index position plus 1

del ex_list[index]
will delete element with the specified index

ex_list.replace(new, old):
will replace new element in old index position

There are a ton of methods that can be done on lists!

List challenge problems:

1. Write a function to alter a list by changing elements of position i to i+1
ex:
[1, 2, 3, 4] -> [4, 1, 2, 3]

 '''

'''
2. Write a boolean function that takes two inputs, a list of integers and an integer
it will return true if the input integer is a element within the list
ex:
([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) -> True
([1, 2, 3, 4], 5) -> False
'''

'''
3. Write a void function that takes an input of list of integers and alters each element within the list
by cubing each element
ex:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
